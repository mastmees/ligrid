The amplifier has two identical channels, a dual opamp is used for each.
The first stage of each channel is high-pass filter that gets rid of most
low frequency noise, the second state is a simple amplifier stage. The
stages are AC coupled using 100nF capacitor. Regular 5% tolerance parts
will work fine.

Power is supplied from single 0..12V AC wall-wart, followed by half-wave
rectifier for positive and negative side. 78L09 and 79L09 regulators feed
the opamps.

Parallel capacitors are placed on antenna inputs, making the antenna
resonate at around 10kHz. For the square winding with about 0.7
meter side length on my antenna, 1uF capacitors were a good match
for 12 loops of wire. Note that for timing based detection networks
you should not use the capacitors as these will affect signal timing.

I built mine on perfboard, wiring under the board with AWG30 wire-wrap
wire in places where I could not connect the components directly. I used
screw terminals for connections to input, output, and power. For antenna,
I used a regular 1.5 square millimeters insulated electrical wire,
and shielded audio cable to connect the amplifier to line input of a PC.
